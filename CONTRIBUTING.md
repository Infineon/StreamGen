## Setup development environment

### Requirements

* Poetry: [https://python-poetry.org/docs/](https://python-poetry.org/docs/)

After installing Poetry and cloning the project from GitHub, you should run the following command from the root of the cloned project:

```sh
poetry install --all-extras --sync --compile
```

All of the project's dependencies should be installed and the project ready for further development.

To activate the newly created virtual environment, call `poetry shell`.

## Development Tasks

StreamGen uses [Poe the Poet](https://github.com/nat-n/poethepoet) as a task runner, to document common workflows and simplify their invocation.

Poe tasks are defined in the `pyproject.toml` file.

### Testing

Manually run the tests:

```sh
poe test
```

### Documentation

Build the documentation locally:

```sh
poe docs_local
```

Build and publish docs:

```sh
poe docs
```
